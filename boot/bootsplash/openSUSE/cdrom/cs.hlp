mainNápověda zavaděčeWelcome to openSUSE 11.1
Use this menu to select the desired function. If you have problems navigating in this help system, press F1 to enter the helppopis of the help system. The main functions in this menu are:
harddiskSpustit z disku: This selection will not do anything to the system. It only starts a previously installed operating system.
linuxInstalace: This installation mode works on most machines. If you experience a system freeze during boot or problems with detection of your hardware components, such as disk controllers or network cards, try one of the following installation options.
noacpiInstalace -- bez ACPI: Many of the currently-sold computers have incomplete or faulty ACPI implementations. This selection disables ACPI support in the kernel, but still enables many performance features, like DMA for IDE hard disks.
nolapicInstalace -- bez local APIC: If the normal installation fails, this might be due to the system hardware not supporting local APIC. If this seems to be the case, use this option to install without local APIC support.
failsafeInstalace -- bezpečné nastavení: If you were not successful with Instalace, this selection might solve the issue.
rescueZáchranný systém: This boot image starts a small Linux system in RAM. This is useful if the system does not start properly. After booting this system, log in as root.
firmwareTest firmwaru: Runs a BIOS test tool that validates ACPI and other parts of your BIOS.
memtestTest paměti: Memory testing is useful for more than checking installation of new memory modules. It is a stress test for a big part of your computer system and may indicate hardware problems.
optParametry startu: The boot options may change the behavior of your system completely. They are settings for the kernel.
helpF1 Help: This is context sensitive. It will show different screens depending on the active element of the boot screen. There is also a description of this help system available.
keytableF2: Set language and keyboard mapping used by the boot loader.
videomodeF3 Video Mode: Here, choose between different screen resolutions while installing. If you encounter problems with the graphical installation, the textový režim may be a work-around for you.
install_srcF4 Installation Source: Choose the installation source.
driverupdateF6 Driver Update: For very new machines, a driver update may be needed to install the system.bitsVýběr softwaruYou have the choice to install the 32-bit or 64-bit version of openSUSE 11.1.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčedriverupdateAktualizace ovladačeIf you need a driver update floppy or CD-ROM, press F6. The boot loader asks you to insert the driver update medium after loading the Linux kernel.
A driver update is typically a floppy with new versions of hardware drivers or bug fixes needed during installation.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčefailsafeInstalace -- bezpečné nastaveníSelect Instalace -- bezpečné nastavení if you encounter hangs while installing or irreproducible errors. This option disables DMA for IDE drives and all power management features. See also the kernel options for o_apmapm, o_acpiacpi and o_ideide.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčefirmwareTest firmwaruStarts a BIOS checker that validates the ACPI tables and many other parts of your BIOS. Test results can be stored on usb disk or saved via network.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčeharddiskSpustit z diskuSelect Spustit nainstalovaný systém to start the system installed on your local hard disk. This system must be installed properly, because only the MBR (Master Boot Record) on the first hard disk is started. The device ID of the first hard disk is provided by the BIOS of the computer.
Use this if you forgot to remove the CD or DVD from your drive and want to start the computer from the hard disk.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčehelpPoužití systému nápovědyThe boot loader online help is context sensitive. It gives information about the selected menu item or, if you are editing boot options, it tries to look up information about the option in which the cursor is positioned.
Navigation Keys 

This is the same as using the o_installinstalovat boot option.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčekeytableVýběr jazyka a rozložení klávesnicePress F2 to change language and keyboard layout the boot loader uses.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčelinuxInstalaceSelect Instalace to start the default installation. The optparametry startu entered are used in the start-up. This item activates many features of commonly available hardware.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčememtestTest pamětiThe included Test paměti provides good possibilities to stress test the hardware of a system. Its main purpose is to detect broken RAM, but it also stresses many other parts of the system.
There is no guarantee that the memory is good if no errors are found, although most of memory defects will be found.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčenoacpiInstalace -- bez ACPICurrent hardware usually requires ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) to control the interrupt handling. ACPI completely replaces the old APM system.
Select Instalace -- bez ACPI if you encounter problems during boot of the kernel. Known problems with machines that have problems with ACPI are: 
  • kernel freezes when booting  • PCI Cards are not detected or initialized properly
You may also try the firmwareTest firmwaru boot option and look at the test results of the ACPI validation.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčenolapicInstalace -- bez local APICNormally there are no problems with the APIC (Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller). But if you seem to have some, try this option to boot without local APIC support.
Please don't confuse this with noacpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface).Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčeoptParametry startuThere are two types of boot options available. First, there are options that affect the installer. Second, there are kernel options. Some of the more common options are:
a) installer options 
  • o_installinstalovat -- select an installation source  • networknastavení sítě -- the network options  • o_vncnastavení vnc -- options for installation via VNC
b) kernel options 
  • o_splashsplash -- influence the behavior of the splash screen  • o_apmapm -- toggle power management  • o_acpiacpi -- advanced configuration and power interface  • o_ideide -- control the IDE subsystemNávrat k mainNápověda zavaděčeo_hostipo_netmasko_gatewaynetworkParametry instalátoru: síťové nastaveníIt is possible to configure the network interface right now. The hardware will be detected later by YaST2. The minimum set of options to configure your network card consists of host IP and netmask. For example: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10 netmask=255.255.255.0
or in a shorter form: 
  • hostip=192.168.0.10/24
If you specified a o_installsíťová instalace and do not specify both of these options, the installer tries to configure the network interface with dhcp. If you need a default gateway, specify this with the option gateway. For example: 
  • gateway=192.168.0.8Návrat k optParametry startuo_acpiParametry jádra: acpiACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is a standard that defines power and configuration management interfaces between an operating system and the BIOS. By default, acpi is switched on when a BIOS is detected that is newer than from year 2000. There are several commonly used parameters to control the behavior of ACPI: 
  • pci=noacpi -- do not use ACPI to route PCI interrupts  • acpi=oldboot -- only the parts of ACPI that are relevant for booting remain activated  • acpi=off -- switch off ACPI completely  • acpi=force -- switch on ACPI even if your BIOS is dated before 2000
Especially on new computers, it replaces the old o_apmapm system.Návrat k optParametry startuo_apmParametry jádra: apmAPM is one of the two power management strategies used on current computers. It is mainly used with laptops for functions like suspend to disk, but it may also be responsible for switching off the computer after power down. APM relies on a correct working BIOS. If the BIOS is broken, APM may have only limited use or even prevent the computer from working. Therefore, it may be switched off with the parameter 
  • apm=off -- switch off APM completely
Some very new computers may take more advantage from the newer o_acpiACPI.Návrat k optParametry startuo_ideParametry jádra: ideIDE is, unlike SCSI, commonly used in most desktop workstations. To circumvent some hardware problems that occur with IDE systems, use the kernel parameter: 
  • ide=nodma -- switch off DMA for IDE drivesNávrat k optParametry startuo_installParametry instalátoru: installBy default, the local CD-ROMs are searched for the installation source. For a network install, select the instalovat option. Possible installation protocols are 
  • FTP  • NFS  • HTTP
The syntax to use is just like standard URLs. For example, if your server is found at 192.168.0.1 and you want to do an NFS-based install from the directory /install on this server, specify the source as follows: 
  • install=nfs://192.168.0.1/install
The network card will either be configured with dhcp or you must specify the parameters yourself as described in the networknastavení sítě.Návrat k optParametry startuo_splashParametry jádra: splashThe splash screen is the picture shown during system start-up. 
  • splash=0 -- The splash screen is switched off. This may be useful with very old monitors or if some error occurs.  • splash=verbose -- Activates splash, kernel and boot messages are still shown.  • splash=silent -- Activates splash, but no messages. Instead a progress bar is drawn.Návrat k optParametry startuo_vncpasswordo_vncParametry instalátoru: vncTo enable the VNC installation, specify the parameters vnc and vncpassword: 
  • vnc=1 vncpassword=example
The VNC server will be started and you may control YaST2 over any VNC client from a remote system.Návrat k optParametry starturescueZáchranný systémThe Záchranný systém is a small RAM disk base system. From there, it is possible to make all kinds of changes to an installed system. Because only low-level tools are available in this system, it is intended for experts.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděčevideomodeVýběr video režimuPress F3 to get the list of video modes your graphics card supports. The highest mode your monitor can display is preselected.
It is possible that your monitor cannot be detected automatically. In that case, select your preferred mode manually.
If your system has problems with the graphics card during the installation, the textový režim may be a usable work-around.Návrat k mainNápověda zavaděče 
